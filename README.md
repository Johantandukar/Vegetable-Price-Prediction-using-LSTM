# 🥦 Vegetable Price Prediction using LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting vegetable prices in Nepal using historical market data from the **Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board**. By analyzing price trends and seasonal patterns, the system forecasts future vegetable prices using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** deep learning model.  
The predictions aim to support **farmers, traders, and policymakers** in making informed decisions within agricultural markets.
