# Vegetable-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
Overview
This project focuses on predicting vegetable prices in Nepal using historical market data from the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market. By analyzing trends and patterns, this system forecasts future prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model. The predictions aim to help farmers, traders, and policymakers make informed decisions in agricultural markets.
Features
Data Analysis & Visualization: Explore historical vegetable price trends, seasonal patterns, and volatility.
Time-Series Forecasting: Implement LSTM-based models for accurate price prediction.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R².
Market Insights: Identify trends for decision-making and strategic planning in agriculture.
